# SQL-Challenge

Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company), has asked me to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. Using six CSV files, I have found important info about these employees through data modeling using an ERD, along with data engineering and data analysis by SQL using pgAdmin 4.
